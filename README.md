# Larry â€“ my offline AI buddy ðŸ¤–

This is Larry, my experiment with making a local AI assistant.  
He runs on **alpaca-7b (gguf)** using **llama.cpp**, no internet needed.  

Right now Larry can:  
- remember chats for a while (short-term memory)  
- keep facts stored forever with **FAISS + embeddings** (long-term memory)  
- greet me in different ways each time  
- change how he talks with little prompt tweaks  

Basically Iâ€™m teaching him step by step, and this repo is where I keep track of it.  
Not a finished product â€” just my AI study buddy in progress ðŸ˜„
